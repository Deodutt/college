Old School Runescape is a previous version of Runescape. Many of the Runescape users made a petition to get the previous 2007 Runescape back because the current version was being ruined by bad ideas. It was later released and became Free to play. Old School Runescape was developed by Jagex. It is a fantasy MMORPG that allows users to free roam around the virtual world. You can do things to cutting wood, fire making, combat, magic, hunting, agility, etc. There are also quest which users can do to achieve rewards. Level 99 in any stat will grant users a "skillcape" This can be shown off for fashion.
<br>
<br>
Old School Runescape is free to play! There are some stats that require memebership but memberships can be obtained with old school runescape currency, gold. Even though its pretty hard to get enough gold, its possbiel.

<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; "> "Old School Runescape is way better than regular Runescape 3. OSRS is a fun game if you played the original game. I sadly stopped playing this game because it takes forever to level up at higher levels. I dont have the time to level up my stats at high levels." </h3>

<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; "> "This game is a fun grind. I enjoy all aspects of this game. PKing is my favorite part of this game but I enjoy questing, levling my stats to 99, and raiding with my friends. Overall recommend this game to everyone." </h3>
