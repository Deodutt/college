<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Ricardo Deodutt</h2>
<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; ">"At first I thought this game just sucked, but I started playing it with friends and loved it. Now I have bought the battle pass and wasted tons of money on this game just to look cool. I would suggest this game instead of games like H1Z1 and Player Unkown BattleGrounds because this game is way faster and interesting with the build mechanics." </h3>

<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; ">"This game is interesting. At first I hated it because I could not build good, but I started getting used to it. I bought the battle pass because my friends peer-pressured me to get it." </h3>
