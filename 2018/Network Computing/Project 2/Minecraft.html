<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; "> "This game was fun at first. Minecraft is really fun if you play with friends you know. Since I dont have any friends this game was a waste of money." </h3>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</h2>
<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; "> "The price of this game is pretty expensive. The creators should lower the price. Other than that I dont find this game worth buying anymore because all the hype died out. People are moving towards games that are esports ready. Also people love to play more battle royale, last man standing video games now. Minecraft was really popular before but just isn't now." </h3>
