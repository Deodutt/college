<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; "> "This game is fun but limits players who don't pay for membership. If you want to have fun in this game, I suggest you buying the memebership for $10 a month. There is little one can do without this membership." </h3>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Ricardo</h2>
<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; "> "This game is my childhood. I've played this game since the 5th grade. The whole game is an amazing idea. A card game that allows users to walk around and do what they want is a great idea. Along with that there is a a cool PVP area that is fun to do. " </h3>
