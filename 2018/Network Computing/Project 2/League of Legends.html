<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal; "> "League of Legends is an amazing free to play game. I started playing this game in 2014 and still play. This game can get annoying at sometimes, but the overall game is amazing. I love the ranking system and even the e-sports part of this game. I love rooting for teams that eventually lose because I am unlucky." </h3>
