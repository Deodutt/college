<h2> I am currently a sophomore computer science major at York College. I was a previous student at Thomas A. Edison High school. While attending this high school, I would learn skills how to communicate with others in an Automotive course. I would have to learn how to troubleshoot problems on customer's vehicle and come up with solutions. This was a great introduction to the computer science field. My goal is to graduate and find a job in the Web Development field. </h2>
