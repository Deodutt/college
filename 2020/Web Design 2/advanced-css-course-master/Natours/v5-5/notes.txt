design2 â€“ natours features and tours
design2 05 Natours Project with Sass Part 3, videos 038-041

To accomplish the angled look of the top and bottom of the features section, the tutorial makes use of CSS selectors to skew the parent then de-skew the direct children. 

Why direct children vs. all children? 
How do both selectors work? 
Describe how this works using a SCSS code snippet to illustrate.

We can use the clip path to give skew path but we can skew the entire section

    transform: skewY(-7deg);
skews all the items


we skew entire section
and unskew the items

New selector. direct child selector
 & > *
direct child we want to select is all of them
but only everything that is a direct child of section-features

.section-features > *


if we did .section-features *
we would select all the child. not only the direct teh child but simply all the children element
we only want to select direct children which is the .row


so the direct child will only select the first child it comes across and then apply the styles we put in..
