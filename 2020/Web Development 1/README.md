## Web Development 1

This course was instructed by Michael Branson Smith. Michael had a unique approach to this course. He assigned a certain amount of videos for us to watch on the topic. Once we finished watching, we had some problem sets. We had to upload all our notes and problem sets to our domains that we created. My domain was https://Rixardo.com . (This domain is expired.) We also had to make blog post explaining out work. Overall this was a great course
