    <h1>FizzBuzz – This is a classic loop problem for which the solution exists in a myriad of languages and methods.
        Write a program that console.log’s the numbers 1 to 100. Except log for numbers divisible by 3 log “Fizz”,
        numbers divisible by 5 log “Buzz”, and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 log “FizzBuzz”.</h1>
