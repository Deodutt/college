    <h1>How are you really feeling? Write a program that asks “How are you feeling?” Then have the program immediately
        ask again, “How are you really feeling?” Have the program compare the statements. If the statements match, then
        send a message, “Wow so you really feel insert feeling” If they don’t match send a message, “Ok so you’re not
        sure if you’re firstFeeling or secondFeeling.”</h1>
