    <h1>What’s the weather? Write a program that asks a user what the weather looks like today. Using a switch
        statement, have your program respond with advice to the following answers, “rain”, “cloudy”, “sunny”, “cold”,
        “hot”, and for all other answers let the user know, “I don’t have any advice for you today, sorry.”</h1>
