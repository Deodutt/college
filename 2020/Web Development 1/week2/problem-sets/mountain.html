    <h1>***BONUS*** Climbing Up the Mountain – Take the phrase, “Climbing up the Mountain” and log one letter per line
        but in reverse. Also the last line should have one space in front, the second to last two spaces, etc. This will
        give the impression of a the letters going up to a peak. Hint: You will need to employ new string methods.</h1>
