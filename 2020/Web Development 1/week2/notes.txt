introduction

Boolean Logic
2 possible options ; true or false

>     ; greater than
>=    ; greater than or equal to
<     ; less than
<=    ; less than or equal to
==    ; equal to
!=    ; not equal to
===   ; equal value and type
!==   ; not equal value or equal type


=== is much safer and specific.. checks if its a string or if the data tpye is a number...
STRICT EQUALS - cares about type and value
NaN = not a number 



081
Logical Operators

&& AND
|| OR
! NOT

Truthy and Falsy Values
"hello"

negatte "hello", and I get true back, it tells you the string "hello" is Falsy
!"hello"
!!"hello"  dobule negate

Falsy Values
false
""
null
undefied
NaN
0
everything else is truthy

NaN
"8"
!Number

corection is to corece a number to string and a string to  nuber.
one primitive tyoe to another.

falseyness function

using falseyness to test the value.
!Number(str) to test if thats a number

//
for loop SyntaxError

while (condition) doesmnnt have CSSStyleDeclarationin the while loop you need the incrementer and intitier. declare before setting condition.CSSStyleDeclarationin
//



082
JS Conditionals
if
else if
else

if you are younger than 18
you cannot enter the venue


if you are between 18 and 21
you can enter but cannot drink

otherwise you can enter and drink


if (age < 18){
    console.log("Sorry, you are too young);
}

else if (age <21){
    console.log("You can enter, but you can't drink);
}

else{
    console.log("come on in.")
}

083
Number(guess) turns the guess, the users inputed string, into a number.

084
Javascript loops

wet code = write everything twice

While Loops

while (someCondition){
    runn some code
}


var count = 1;

while (count <6 ){
    console.log("count is: " + count);
    count++
    count+= 2;
}

var str = "hello";

var count = 0;

while (count <str.length){
    console.log(str[count]);
    count++
}

089
For Loops
for (init; condition; step){
    runs code
}

the varible in the for loop only exist in the for loop.***********************
for (let count = 0; count < 6; count++){
    console.log(count);
}
