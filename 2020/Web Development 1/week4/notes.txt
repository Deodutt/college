With the array methods pop() / push() and shift() / unshift(), explain the difference between the returned value of each method and the resulting value of the array? Use an example piece of code with the Enlighter tool to support your description.


Link to an example of a site that is using an array of data that is presented on page. Describe what is in value of the array.

objective 1: define and add data to an array
objective 2: use built in array methods
exercise console todo list

What arrays are and y we use it
To make a group of friends, u could make 4 variables.
code is dry and repeated code. also each variable is seperate

an array lets us group data in a list
we can write 1 varaible and store 4 different names

var friends = ["charlie", "Liz", "David", "Mattias"];
Arrays are indexed starting at 0.

friends[0] = charlie
this replaced index 0 to charlie.

friends[4] = "Amelie" this will make another index
let colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"];



arrays can be defined differeent

let friends = [];  empty array

let friends = new Array()     // function.

let random_collection = [49, true, "qadeerisgay", null];

let nums = [45,28,48,89];
nums.length //4

push/pop
shift/unshift
indexOf
Slice

push and pop
let colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"];
push = adding something to very end of array
colors.push("green");

colors.push("indigo")
push knows the end of array. adds whatever u pass into the end
push returns length of array after the new element is added
push takes one argument and will add to end of array and return the length of array

Pop removes the last element in the array.

colors.pop();
use pop to remove from array and use it
returns the last item in the array and removes it.
pop is used to remove something from array and do something with it
pop takes no argument and returns the last item in the array it uses.



sift and unshift
they add and remove from the end of the array // stacks and queues

shift and unshift are the opposite of push and pop

unshift = to add to front of an array.
returns the lnegth of array after it moves the item to the front???????
colors.unshift("infrared")

shift = removes frist item in an aray and returns that item.
returns the item it removes.
colors.shift();

var nums = [34, 54, 22];

nums.unshift("hell");
4



IndexdOf

Takes an argument like a string/num and tries to find that argumeent in a given array.


let friends = ["Charlie", "liz", "david", "Mattias", "Liz];

friends.indexOf("David"); // 2

friends.indexOf("Liz"); // 1, not 4

indedOf returns first instance if its repeated...



if indexOf returns -1, it is not present in the array.





Slice is used to copy different portions of an array.


var fruits = [ 'banana', 'orange', 'lemon', 'apple', 'mango'];
var citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3);
slice takes 2 arguments
1st one is the index, and the second is where the slice should stop.
so it should start at ornage, and stop at apple. It includes orange and lemon but DOES NOT include apple.

when var citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3); is ran
citrus becoems a new array
['Orange', 'Lemon']
original array is un altered

to copy entire array we just ue var otherArray = nums.slice();




108 array iteration

use a foor loop to iterate over an array

use forEach to iterate over an array
compare and contrast for loops and forEach

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++){
    console.log(colors[i]);
}

For each is new to java. 2009
arr.forEach(someFunction)


var colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green",];

colors.forEach(function(color){
    color is a placeholder,call it whatever you want
    console.log(color);
}
