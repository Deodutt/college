Blog Question
Link to an example dynamic webpage that likely pulls data from a database to build the site – any social media site, newspaper, blog, etc. Take a screenshot of a typical “post” and propose an object data structure to store all the elements of the post. Use the Enlighter code embed tool to include your proposed object design in a code sample.


114 introduction to objects
let person = ["Cindy", 32, "Missoula];
person[2];
let person2 = ["Travis", "Los Angeles", 21];

Arrays is not the perfect solution for every situation

Javascript Objects is the perfect
let person = {
    name: "Cindy",
    age: 32,
    city: "Missoula"
}

let person = {
    name: "Travis",
    age: 21,
    city: "Los Angeles"
}

Unlike array, which has an order 1st item, 2nd item, 3rd item
Ojbects have no array. Things floating inside

To retrive data out of an object you have 2 chocies

console.log(person["name"]);

//Dot Notation
console.log(person.name);
