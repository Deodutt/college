    <h1>JS Objects Problem Set</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>CT course count for loop – Create a function ctCourseCount(studArr) that takes the supplied array of objects
            data structure as a value. When called, use a for loop to print a value for each student and the number of
            CT courses taken. For example: “Voski Dreher has taken 9 courses in CT.”
            <ol>
                <li>ctCourseCount(students);</li>
            </ol>
        </li>


        <li>CT course count forEach – Create a function ctCourseCountforEach(studArr) that takes the supplied array of
            objects data structure as a
            value. When called, use a forEach method to print a value for each student and the number of CT courses
            taken. For example: “Voski Dreher has taken 9 courses in CT.”
            <ol>
                <li>ctCourseCountforEach(students);</li>
            </ol>
        </li>


        <li>CT students not enrolled – Create a function isNotEnrolled(studArr) takes the supplied array of objects data
            structure as a value. When
            called, the console prints a list of students that are not enrolled. For example, “Wolf Shepard” should be
            on that list.
            <ol>
                <li>isNotEnrolled(students);</li>
            </ol>
        </li>


        <li>CT courses taken – Create a function coursesTaken(studArr) that takes the supplied array of objects data
            structure as a value.
            When called, the console prints a list of students and every course that student has taken. For example,
            “Wolf Shepard has taken: CT 101, CT 201, CT 137, CT 160, CT 360”
            <ol>
                <li>coursesTaken(students);</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

    </ol>
